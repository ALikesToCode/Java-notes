## Section 2.1: Your First Java Program

### 2.1.1 The Tradition of "Hello, World!"

The journey into programming often begins with a simple program that outputs "Hello, world!" This tradition helps new programmers familiarize themselves with the process of writing, compiling, and executing code.

#### Writing "Hello, World!" in Different Languages

**Python Example:**

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

- Python allows you to print directly using the `print()` function without any additional structure or declarations.

**C Example:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

- C requires including a standard library (`stdio.h`), defining a `main()` function, and using `printf()` to output text.

### 2.1.2 Writing "Hello, World!" in Java

**Java Example:**

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

At first glance, Java's version appears more complex. Let's break it down to understand each component.

### 2.1.3 Understanding the Java Program Structure

#### Classes in Java

- **Class Definition:** `public class HelloWorld { ... }`
  - In Java, **everything is contained within a class**. You cannot have standalone functions or statements outside a class.

#### The `main()` Method

- **Method Signature:** `public static void main(String[] args) { ... }`
  - **public:** The method is accessible from anywhere.
  - **static:** Belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class. This means it can be called without creating an object.
  - **void:** The method does not return any value.
  - **main:** The entry point of any Java application.
  - **String[] args:** An array of `String` objects, representing command-line arguments passed to the program.

#### Outputting Text

- **Printing to Console:** `System.out.println("Hello, world!");`
  - **System.out:** A standard output stream provided by Java.
  - **println():** A method that prints the provided text followed by a newline character.

#### Punctuation and Syntax

- **Braces `{}`:** Define the beginning and end of classes and methods.
- **Semicolons `;`:** End statements in Java.

### 2.1.4 Compiling and Running Java Programs

Java uses a two-step process involving compilation and execution.

#### Compilation

- Use the Java compiler `javac` to compile your source code into bytecode.
  ```bash
  javac HelloWorld.java
  ```
- This generates a `HelloWorld.class` file containing the bytecode.

#### Execution

- Run the bytecode using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  ```bash
  java HelloWorld
  ```
- **Note:** Do not include the `.class` extension when running the program.

#### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

- The JVM interprets the compiled bytecode and executes it on the host machine.
- **Portability:** Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy means that compiled Java code can run on any device equipped with a JVM.

### 2.1.5 Key Takeaways

- Java programs are structured around classes and methods.
- The `main()` method serves as the starting point.
- Java's syntax requires attention to detail, such as proper use of braces and semicolons.
- Understanding the compilation and execution process is essential for running Java programs.

## Section 2.2: Basic Data Types in Java

Data types specify the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program. Java provides both primitive data types and objects to handle data efficiently.

### 2.2.1 Primitive Data Types

Java's primitive data types are not objects; they hold simple values directly for efficiency.

#### Numeric Types

1. **Integer Types**

   - **byte**: 1 byte, range from -128 to 127.
   - **short**: 2 bytes, range from -32,768 to 32,767.
   - **int**: 4 bytes, range from -2^31^ to 2^31^-1.
   - **long**: 8 bytes, range from -2^63^ to 2^63^-1.

2. **Floating-Point Types**

   - **float**: 4 bytes, single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754.
   - **double**: 8 bytes, double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754.

#### Character Type

- **char**: 2 bytes, stores a single Unicode character.

#### Boolean Type

- **boolean**: 1 byte (size not precisely defined), values are `true` or `false`.

### 2.2.2 Variable Declaration and Initialization

Variables must be declared with a type before use.

```java
int count;          // Declaration
count = 10;         // Assignment
```

Or combined:

```java
int count = 10;     // Declaration and initialization
```

#### Multiple Declarations

```java
int x = 5, y = 10;
```

### 2.2.3 Working with Strings

Strings are objects in Java, instances of the `String` class.

```java
String greeting = "Hello, world!";
```

- Strings are **immutable**; once created, they cannot be changed.

#### String Concatenation

```java
String firstName = "Jane";
String lastName = "Doe";
String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "Jane Doe"
```

### 2.2.4 Unicode Support

Java uses Unicode, allowing for international character representation.

```java
char letter = 'A';
char piSymbol = '\u03C0'; // Unicode for Ï€
```

- Unicode escape sequences use the format `\uXXXX`, where `XXXX` is the hexadecimal code.

### 2.2.5 Constants with the `final` Keyword

The `final` keyword makes a variable's value unchangeable (constant).

```java
final double PI = 3.141592653589793;
```

- Attempting to modify `PI` will result in a compile-time error.

### 2.2.6 Operators and Expressions

#### Arithmetic Operators

- **Addition (+)**: `int sum = a + b;`
- **Subtraction (-)**: `int difference = a - b;`
- **Multiplication (*)**: `int product = a * b;`
- **Division (/)**: `int quotient = a / b;`
- **Modulus (%)**: `int remainder = a % b;`

#### Increment and Decrement Operators

- **Increment (++)**: `count++;` or `++count;`
- **Decrement (--)**: `count--;` or `--count;`

#### Exponentiation

- Java does not have an exponentiation operator. Use `Math.pow()`.

```java
double result = Math.pow(2, 3); // 8.0
```

#### Integer Division

- Dividing two integers discards the fractional part.

```java
int result = 7 / 2; // Result is 3
```

### 2.2.7 Arrays

Arrays store multiple values of the same type.

#### Declaration and Creation

```java
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // An array of 5 integers
```

#### Initialization

```java
int[] primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
```

#### Accessing Elements

- Zero-based indexing: `int firstPrime = primes[0]; // 2`

#### Array Length

```java
int length = primes.length; // 5
```

### 2.2.8 Key Points

- Primitive data types offer efficient data handling.
- Strings and arrays are objects, providing additional functionality.
- Understanding data types is crucial for proper variable declaration and manipulation.

## Section 2.3: Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements determine the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated.

### 2.3.1 Conditional Statements

#### The `if` Statement

Executes a block of code if a condition is true.

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
}
```

#### The `if-else` Statement

Provides an alternative execution path if the condition is false.

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code if condition is true
} else {
    // Code if condition is false
}
```

#### The `if-else if-else` Ladder

Handles multiple conditions.

```java
if (condition1) {
    // Code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code if none of the above conditions are true
}
```

**Note:** Braces `{}` are required for multiple statements but optional for single statements.

### 2.3.2 Looping Statements

#### The `while` Loop

Repeats a block of code while a condition is true.

```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to repeat
}
```

#### The `do-while` Loop

Executes the code block once before checking the condition.

```java
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

#### The `for` Loop

Used when the number of iterations is known.

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to repeat
}
```

**Example:**

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println("i = " + i);
}
```

#### The Enhanced `for` Loop

Simplifies looping through arrays or collections.

```java
for (type element : array) {
    // Use element
}
```

**Example:**

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
```

### 2.3.3 The `switch` Statement

Selects a block of code to execute based on the value of an expression.

```java
switch (variable) {
    case value1:
        // Code block
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code block
        break;
    default:
        // Default code block
}
```

- **Break Statement:** Prevents fall-through to subsequent cases.
- **Fall-Through Behavior:** Without `break`, execution continues to the next case.

**Example:**

```java
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Another day");
}
```

### 2.3.4 Key Concepts

- Control flow statements guide the execution path of a program.
- Proper use of loops and conditionals allows for dynamic and responsive programs.
- The `switch` statement provides a clear structure for multi-way branching.

## Section 2.4: Classes and Objects

Java is an object-oriented language, meaning it uses objects to model real-world entities.

### 2.4.1 Defining a Class

A class serves as a blueprint for objects.

```java
public class Date {
    // Fields, constructors, and methods
}
```

#### Access Modifiers

- **public:** Accessible from other classes.
- **private:** Accessible only within the declared class.

### 2.4.2 Fields (Instance Variables)

Variables that hold the state of an object.

```java
public class Date {
    private int day;
    private int month;
    private int year;
}
```

- Declared as `private` to enforce encapsulation.

### 2.4.3 Constructors

Special methods invoked when creating an object.

```java
public Date(int day, int month, int year) {
    this.day = day;
    this.month = month;
    this.year = year;
}
```

- **Overloading Constructors:** Having multiple constructors with different parameters.

```java
public Date() {
    // Default constructor
}

public Date(int day, int month) {
    this(day, month, 2023); // Calls another constructor
}
```

### 2.4.4 The `this` Keyword

Refers to the current object instance.

```java
public void setDate(int day, int month, int year) {
    this.day = day;
    this.month = month;
    this.year = year;
}
```

### 2.4.5 Methods

Functions that define behaviors of objects.

```java
public int getDay() {
    return day;
}

public void setDay(int day) {
    this.day = day;
}
```

- **Accessor Methods (Getters):** Retrieve field values.
- **Mutator Methods (Setters):** Modify field values.

### 2.4.6 Creating Objects

Instantiate objects using the `new` keyword.

```java
Date today = new Date(27, 10, 2023);
```

### 2.4.7 Copy Constructors

Create a new object by copying an existing one.

```java
public Date(Date otherDate) {
    this.day = otherDate.day;
    this.month = otherDate.month;
    this.year = otherDate.year;
}
```

### 2.4.8 Encapsulation

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
- **Access Control:** Using access modifiers to restrict access to the inner workings of a class.

### 2.4.9 Key Points

- Classes define the structure and behavior of objects.
- Encapsulation protects the integrity of data.
- Constructors initialize new objects.
- Methods allow interaction with an object's data.

## Section 2.5: Input and Output in Java

Input and output (I/O) operations enable programs to interact with users and other systems.

### 2.5.1 Output Operations

#### Using `System.out.println()`

Outputs text followed by a newline.

```java
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
```

#### Using `System.out.print()`

Outputs text without a newline.

```java
System.out.print("Hello, ");
System.out.print("world!");
```

#### Formatted Output with `System.out.printf()`

Similar to `printf()` in C, allows formatted strings.

```java
String name = "Alice";
int age = 30;
System.out.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d%n", name, age);
```

- **Format Specifiers:**
  - `%s`: String
  - `%d`: Integer
  - `%f`: Floating-point number
  - `%n`: Newline character

### 2.5.2 Input Operations

#### Using the `Scanner` Class

Reads input from various sources, commonly `System.in`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
String name = scanner.nextLine();

System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
int age = scanner.nextInt();
```

- **Common Methods:**
  - `nextLine()`: Reads a line of text.
  - `nextInt()`: Reads an integer.
  - `nextDouble()`: Reads a double.
- **Closing the Scanner:**
  ```java
  scanner.close();
  ```

#### Using the `Console` Class

Provides methods to read from the console, with additional features like reading passwords.

```java
Console console = System.console();
if (console != null) {
    String username = console.readLine("Username: ");
    char[] password = console.readPassword("Password: ");
}
```

- **Note:** The `Console` object may not be available in all environments.

### 2.5.3 Key Concepts

- **Standard Output:** `System.out` stream for displaying information.
- **Standard Input:** `System.in` stream for receiving user input.
- **Formatted Output:** Use `printf()` for structured output.
